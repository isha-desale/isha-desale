# Hi 👋 I'm Isha Desale  
Electronics Engineering Student

🔧 Interested in Automation, Embedded Systems & Core Electronics  
💡 Working on Arduino-based projects and practical Electronics  

## 🔹 About me
- Electronics Engineering student passionate about **core electronics**
- Learning and building projects using **Arduino ,PLC & sensors**
- Interested in **Embedded Systems, Automation, and Hardware-based projects**
- Actively improving practical skills through hands-on projects

## 🔹 Skills
- Arduino Programming
- PLC Programming  
- Embedded Systems Basics  
- Analog & Digital Electronics  
- Circuit Design & Simulation  
- Basics of C Programming
- Basic Python Programming 

## 🔹 Projects
- **1.SMART BANDAGE WITH INFECTION ALERT** 
      The bandage with dual alert to address the issue of delayed wound infection detection, 
      especially for diabetic and Disable Peoples and for rural areas. The bandage uses integrated 
      pH, moisture, and conductivity sensors & Temperature sensor to continuously monitor the 
      wound.
  
  **2.BASIC PLC PROGRAMING PROJECTS**
      Traffic Light Control System, 6&3-Floor Lift Automation, Automatic Sreet Lighting System, 
      Motor Control Applications, Conveyor Belt Automation.

  **3.ROBOCAR** 
      Built a functional robocar using an Arduino microcontroller, a motor driver, and rechargeable 
      batteries. Design a stable chassis to house the motors and electronic components, ensuring 
      smooth movement and durability. Focused on clean wiring and efficient circuit connections 
      to improve performance.
  
  **4.CUSTOMIZED CURTAIN SET** 
     This project aims to opened and closed the curtains using a remote and will shut always when 
     in the face of extreme sunlight and heat to reduce the light and heat within room. For this, we 
     have used IR sensor for remote sensing, dc motor for open/close of the curtain, thermistor 
     sensor for temperature sensing and batteries for power supply.
